### Background
This is a side project and a work in progress. The motivation is to learn more about (i) html, (ii) google visualizations, (iii) java script, and (iv) explore other _free_ google resources. To make it fun and more meaningful to myself, I am trying to fill a gap in my community, i.e. create a portal to report and share power outages in Camuy. Unfortunately, power outages are recurrent in the island.
